  <h1>Latin Plurals for You</h1>

  <p>Before they all died long, long ago, back in the day when people
     didn't live long enough to get cancer, the speakers of Latin and
     Greek left us some kick-ass words to spice up our vocabularies.
     But they clearly weren't thinking too hard about us, because the
     plural forms of these words are way too easy for English-speakers
     to get wrong.  Horribly wrong.  Dreadfully wrong.
     Kittens-will-die wrong.  I wrote this teensy little guide to help
     people with some of the trickiest ones so that you will stop
     killing kittens you bastard.
  </p>

  <p>First, I give you two simple but powerful rules:
   <ol>
    <li>If you just start sticking the letter <em>i</em> on things,
    kittens will die.  Seriously.</li>
    <li>English plurals are nice when speaking English.  Use
    them!  <em>Octopuses</em>! <em>Viruses</em>! Winnings!</li>
   </ol>
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>
    <div class='lemma'><h3>Octopus</h3>
     <div class='plural'>Real plural: <em>octopodes</em></div>
     <div class='recommended'>Recommend: <em>octopuses</em></div>
     <div class='never'>Never say: <em>octopi</em></div>
    </div>
    <div class='about'>
     This one comes to us from the Greek <em>okto</em>- (meaning eight)
     and <em>pous</em> (meaning foot).  So it means "eight-foot."  It
     comes out in Latin as <em>octopus</em>.  The plural is
     not <strike><em>octopi</em></strike>.  Instead, it would really be
     <em>octopodes</em>, which is awesome.  But since that will probably
     confuse people, best just to say "octopuses."  Just do not
     say <strike><em>octopi</em></strike>.  Kittens will die if you do.
    </div>
    <div class='about'>
     That <em>podes</em> form shows the root of the word, which
     is <em>pod</em>-.  The root is used in other compound forms you
     will recognize, like podiatrist ("foot doctor", from <em>pous</em>
     and <em>iatros</em>).  Note that a "pediatrician" is not related.
     That's from <em>paid<em>- (root of the word for "child"), so "child
     doctor".
    </div>
   </li>

   <li>
    <div class='lemma'><h3>Platypus</h3>
     <div class='plural'>Real plural: <em>platypodes</em></div>
     <div class='recommended'>Recommended: <em>platypuses</em></div>
     <div class='never'>Never say: <em>platypi</em></div>
    </div>
    <div class='about'>
     See <a href='#octopus'>octopus</a> for an explanation of the plural.
     <em>Platy<em>- is from the Greek for "flat."  So a <em>platypus</em>
     is Greek for "police officer."
    </div>
   </li>

   <li>
    <div class='lemma'><h3>Virus</h3>
     <div class='plural'>Real plural: <em>virus</em></div>
     <div class='recommended'>Recommended: <em>viruses</em></div>
     <div class='never'>Never say: <em>virii</em> (Kittens will die)</div>
    </div>
    <div class='about'>
     A lot of the words in Latin that end with -<em>us</em> have a plural in
     -<em>i</em>, but this is not one of them.  There are many other words in
     Latin that sneakily have a singular -<em>us</em> and a plural -<em>us</em>.
    </div>
   </li>

   <li>
    <div class='lemma'><h3>Synopsis</h3>
     <div class='plural'>Real plural: <em>synopses</em></div>
     <div class='recommended'>Recommended: <em>synopses</em></div>
     <div class='never'>Never say: <em>synopsi</em></div>
    </div>
    <div class='about'>
     This is actually a Greek word.  It's from <em>syn<en> "together" and
     <em>opsis</em> "look," so it means a look at things together, or "summary."
     The real plural is <em>synopses</em>, and since <strike><em>synopsises</em></strike>
     sounds totally whack, use the original plural.
    </div>
   </li>

   <li>
    <div class='lemma'><h3>Cactus</h3>
     <div class='plural'>Real plural: <em>cacti</em></div>
     <div class='recommended'>Recommended: <em>cactuses</em></div>
    </div>
    <div class='about'>
     This is one of those Latin words where people who don't know Latin plurals
     get it right by accident.  Personally, I prefer <em>cactuses</em> as the
     plural in English.  <em>Suum cuique</em>.
