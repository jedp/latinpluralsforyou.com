  <h1>Latin Plurals for You</h1>

  <p>Before they all died long, long ago, back in the day when people
     didn't live long enough to get cancer, the speakers of Latin and
     Greek left us some kick-ass words to spice up our vocabularies.
     But they clearly weren't thinking too hard about us, because the
     plural forms of these words are way too easy for English-speakers
     to get wrong.  Horribly wrong.  Dreadfully wrong.
     Kittens-will-die wrong.  I wrote this teensy little guide to help
     people with some of the trickiest ones so that you will stop
     killing kittens you bastard.
  </p>

  <p>First, I give you two simple but powerful rules:
   <ol>
    <li>If you just start sticking the letter <em>i</em> on things,
    kittens will die.  Seriously.</li>
    <li>English plurals are nice when speaking English.  Use
    them and be happy!  <em>Octopuses</em>! <em>Viruses</em>! #Winnings!</li>
   </ol>
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>
    <div class='lemma'><a name='octopus'><h3>Octopus</h3></a>
     <div class='plural'>Real plural: <em>octopodes</em> (fuck yeah!)</div>
     <div class='recommended'>Recommend: <em>octopuses</em></div>
     <div class='never'>Never say: <em>octopi</em></div>
    </div>
    <div class='about'>
     This one comes to us from the Greek <em>okto</em>- (meaning eight)
     and <em>pous</em> (meaning foot).  So it means "eight-foot."  It
     comes out in Latin as <em>octopus</em>.  The plural is
     not <strike><em>octopi</em></strike>.  Instead, it would really be
     <em>octopodes</em>, which is awesome.  But since that will probably
     confuse people, best just to say "octopuses."  Just do not
     say <strike><em>octopi</em></strike>.  Kittens will die if you do.
    </div>
    <div class='about'>
     That <em>podes</em> form shows the root of the word, which
     is <em>pod</em>-.  The root is used in other compound forms you
     will recognize, like podiatrist ("foot doctor", from <em>pous</em>
     and <em>iatros</em>).  Note that a "pediatrician" is not related.
     That's from <em>paid</em>- (root of the word for "child"), so "child
     doctor".
    </div>
   </li>

   <li>
    <div class='lemma'><h3>Platypus</h3>
     <div class='plural'>Real plural: <em>platypodes</em></div>
     <div class='recommended'>Recommended: <em>platypuses</em></div>
     <div class='never'>Never say: <em>platypi</em></div>
    </div>
    <div class='about'>
     See <a href='#octopus'>octopus</a> for an explanation of the plural.
     <em>Platy<em>- is from the Greek for "flat," and
     again, <em>pous</em> means "foot."  So a <em>platypus</em> is
     Greek for "police officer."
    </div>
   </li>

   <li>
    <div class='lemma'><h3>Virus</h3>
     <div class='plural'>Real plural: <em>vir&#x16b;s</em></div>
     <div class='recommended'>Recommended: <em>viruses</em></div>
     <div class='never'>Never say: <em>virii</em> (Kittens will die)</div>
    </div>
    <div class='about'>
     A lot of the words in Latin that end with -<em>us</em> have a
     plural in -<em>i</em>, but this is not one of them.  There are
     many other words in Latin that sneakily have a singular
     -<em>us</em> and a plural -<em>&#x16b;s</em>.  That line over
     the <em>u</em> means that the vowel is pronounced a little
     longer, like the <em>a</em> in English "madder" as compared to
     "matter."  In fact, that vowel lengthening is the only reason we
     can tell those words apart in spoken English, since the
     medial <em>tt</em> and <em>dd</em> are pronounced exactly the
     same.  The Romans also heard the distinction between long and
     short vowels.  Anyway, the point is that the plural for this word
     looks exactly the same as the singular (unless you have a fancy
     macron to put over it), which is just going to confuse people.
     Say "viruses."

   <li>
    <div class='lemma'><h3>Synopsis</h3>
     <div class='plural'>Real plural: <em>synopses</em></div>
     <div class='recommended'>Recommended: <em>synopses</em></div>
     <div class='never'>Never say: <em>synopsi</em></div>
    </div>
    <div class='about'>
     This is actually a Greek word.  It's from <em>syn<en> "together" and
     <em>opsis</em> "look," so it means a look at things together, or
     "summary."  The real plural is <em>synopses</em>, and since the
     English pluralization sounds totally whack in this case
     (<strike><em>synopsises</em></strike>), go with the original Latin.
    </div>
   </li>

   <li>
    <div class='lemma'><h3>Cactus</h3>
     <div class='plural'>Real plural: <em>cacti</em></div>
     <div class='recommended'>Recommended: <em>cactuses</em></div>
    </div>
    <div class='about'>
     This is one of those Latin words where people who don't know Latin plurals
     get it right by accident.  Personally, I prefer <em>cactuses</em> as the
     plural in English, but I can't really argue against people who say 
     <em>cacti</em> and get away with it.  Whatever.  <em>Suum cuique</em>.
    </div>
   </li>

   <li>
    <div class='lemma'><h3>Data</h3>
    <div class='plural'>It is actually plural, but treat it as singular</div>
    <div class='recommended'>Say "the data shows X".  Only douchebags say "the data show X."</div>
    </div>
    <div class='about'>
     In Latin, <em>data</em> is the plural of <em>datum</em>, "given."
     So yes, if we're going to be mindless pedantic twits, we would
     cry out whenever some barbarian said "the data shows" something
     or other.  But look, the Romans didn't have "data," at least not
     in the post-18th-century statistical sense that we have data.
     For us, "data", like a "sample", is a collective; it's a group of
     things.  This word has evolved in modern usage.  Let's let it do
     its thing.  And if you feel like you need some classical
     linguistic model to back you up at your next cocktail party when
     some douchebag in a bowtie says, "I wonder whether you realize
     that <em>data</em> is really plural herp derp derp herp derp,"
     just tell the little guy that it's actually best construed as a
     neuter collective, as in the pre-archaic Latin <em>sena</em>,
     meaning "group of old men," (from the root <em>sen</em>-, meaning
     "old," as in "senile") whence the Latin <em>Senatus</em>, "Group
     of senile old white douchebags."
    </div>
   </li>

   <li>
    <div class='lemma'><h3>Agenda</h3>
     <div class='plural'>It is actually plural, but treat it as singular</div>
     <div class='never'>Never say: <em>agendas</em></div>
    </div>
    <div class='about'>
      The Latin <em>agenda</em> is the plural of <em>agendum<em>.  It
      means "things to do."  Like <a href='#data'>data</a>, this is a
      singular word in English already; it denotes a group of stuff
      treated as a whole.  "Do we have an agenda for this meeting?"
      If you act all fancy and say shit like "Amongst the agenda is an
      item specifying blah," then people will hit you.  You have been
      warned.
