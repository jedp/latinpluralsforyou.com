    <h1>Latin Plurals for You</h1>

    <p>Before they all died long, long ago, back when people didn't
      live long enough to get cancer, the awesome speakers of Latin
      and Greek left us some kick-ass words.  But this is a dangerous
      gift for us, because the correct plural forms of these words are
      way too easy for English-speakers to get wrong.  Horribly,
      dreadfully wrong.  Kittens-will-die wrong.  I wrote this teensy
      little guide to help people with some of the trickiest ones so
      that you will stop killing kittens you bastard.
    </p>

   <p>First, I give you two simple but powerful rules:</p>
   <ol>
     <li>Do not just go around sticking the letter <em>i</em> on
       things.  Kittens will die.</li>
     <li>You're speaking English; you can use English plurals!  They're great!</li>
   </ol>

    <h3>Octopus</h3>
    <div class='info'>
      <div class='lemma'>
        <div class='plural'>Real plural: <em>octopodes</em> (fuck yeah!)</div>
        <div class='recommended'>Recommend: <em>octopuses</em></div>
        <div class='never'>Never say: <em>octopi</em></div>
      </div>
      <div class='about'>
        This one comes to us from the Greek <em>okto</em>- (meaning
        eight) and <em>pous</em> (meaning foot).  So it means
        "eight-foot."  It comes out in Latin spelled <em>octopus</em>.
        The plural is not <strike><em>octopi</em></strike>.  Oh no.
        Instead, it would really be
        <em>octopodes</em>, which is awesome.  If you
        think <em>octopodes</em> will confuse people too much (which it
        will, but why not try anyway, just for fun), then it's best just
        to say "octopuses."  Whatever you do, do not, under any
        circumstances, say <strike><em>octopi</em></strike>.  Kittens
        will die.
      </div>
      <div class='about'>
        Incidentally that <em>podes</em> form shows the root of the word,
        which is <em>pod</em>-.  The root is used in other compound forms
        you will recognize, like podiatrist ("foot doctor",
        from <em>pous</em> and <em>iatros</em>).  Note that a
        "pediatrician" is not related.  That's from <em>paid</em>- (root
        of the word for "child"), so "child doctor".  The corresponding
        Latin word for <em>pous</em> (the actual Latin word for foot)
        is <em>pes</em>.  The Latin root for that is <em>ped</em>-, like
        pedestrian (someone who goes on foot).

    <h3>Platypus</h3>
    <div class='info'>
      <div class='lemma'>
        <div class='plural'>Real plural: <em>platypodes</em></div>
        <div class='recommended'>Recommended: <em>platypuses</em></div>
        <div class='never'>Never say: <em>platypi</em></div>
      </div>
      <div class='about'>
        See <b>Octopus</b> for an explanation of the plural.
        <em>Platy</em>- is from the Greek for "flat," and
        again, <em>pous</em> means "foot."  So a <em>platypus</em> is
        Greek for "police officer."

    <h3>Virus</h3>
    <div class='info'>
      <div class='lemma'>
        <div class='plural'>Real plural: <em>vir&#x16b;s</em> (really)</div>
        <div class='recommended'>Recommended: <em>viruses</em></div>
        <div class='never'>Never say: <em>virii</em> (Kittens will die)</div>
      </div>
      <div class='about'>
        A lot of the words in Latin that end with -<em>us</em> have a
        plural in -<em>i</em>, but this is not one of them.  And it
        definitely doesn't have a plural in -<em>ii</em>.  (I have
        noticed that people with neck beards are particularly given to
        using the bogus plural <strike><em>virii</em></strike>.)
        There are many other words in Latin that sneakily have a
        singular -<em>us</em> and a plural -<em>&#x16b;s</em>.  That
        line over the <em>u</em> means that the vowel is pronounced a
        little longer, like the <em>a</em> in English "madder" as
        compared to "matter."  In fact, that vowel lengthening is the
        only reason we can tell those words apart in spoken English,
        since the medial <em>tt</em> and <em>dd</em> are pronounced
        exactly the same.  The Romans also heard the distinction
        between long and short vowels.  Anyway, the point is that the
        plural for this word looks exactly the same as the singular
        (unless you have a fancy macron to put over it's), which is
        just going to confuse people.  Say "viruses."

    <h3>Synopsis</h3>
    <div class='info'>
      <div class='lemma'>
        <div class='plural'>Real plural: <em>synopses</em></div>
        <div class='recommended'>Recommended: <em>synopses</em></div>
        <div class='never'>Never say: <em>synopsi</em></div>
      </div>
      <div class='about'>
        This is actually a Greek word.  It's from <em>syn</em> "together" and
        <em>opsis</em> "look," so it means a look at things together, or
        "summary."  The real plural is <em>synopses</em>, and since the
        English pluralization sounds totally whack in this case
        (<strike><em>synopsises</em></strike>), go with the original
        Latin.  By the way, there are lots of other words that follow
        this pattern, like <em>crisis</em>/<em>crises</em>
        and <em>thesis</em>/<em>theses</em>, to name a couple.

    <h3>Cactus</h3>
    <div class='info'>
      <div class='lemma'>
        <div class='plural'>Real plural: <em>cacti</em></div>
        <div class='recommended'>Recommended: <em>cactuses</em></div>
      </div>
      <div class='about'>
        This is one of those Latin words where people who don't know Latin plurals
        get it right by accident.  Personally, I prefer <em>cactuses</em> as the
        plural in English, but I can't really argue against people who say
        <em>cacti</em> and get away with it.  Whatever.  <em>Suum cuique</em>.
      </div>

   <li>
    <h3>Data</h3>
    <div class='info'>
      <div class='lemma'>
        <div class='plural'>It is actually plural, but treat it as singular</div>
        <div class='recommended'>Say <em>the data shows X</em>.</div>
        <div class='never'>Only douchebags say <em>the data show X</em>.</div>
      </div>
      <div class='about'>
        In Latin, <em>data</em> is the plural of <em>datum</em>, "given."
        So yes, if we're going to be mindless pedantic twits, we would
        cry out whenever some barbarian said "the data shows" something
        or other.  But look, the Romans didn't have "data," at least not
        in the post-18th-century statistical sense that we have data.
        For us, "data", like a "sample", is a collective; it's a group of
        things.  This word has evolved in modern usage.  Let's let it do
        its thing.
      </div>
      <div class='about'>If you feel like you need some classical
        linguistic model to back you up at your next cocktail party
        when some douchebag in a bowtie scuttles up and says, "I
        wonder whether you realize that <em>data</em> is really plural
        herp derp derp herp derp," just tell the little guy that,
        strictly speaking, yes; but it's better construed as a neuter
        collective, as in the pre-archaic Latin <em>sena</em>, meaning
        "group of old men," (from the root <em>sen</em>-, meaning
        "old," as in "senile") whence the Latin <em>Senatus</em>,
        "Group of senile old white douchebags."

    <h3>Agenda</h3>
    <div class='info'>
      <div class='lemma'>
        <div class='plural'>It is actually plural, but treat it as singular</div>
      </div>
      <div class='about'>
        The Latin <em>agenda</em> is the plural of <em>agendum</em>.
        It means "things to do."  Like <em>data</em>, this
        is a singular word in English already; it denotes a group of
        stuff treated as a whole.  "Do we have an agenda for this
        meeting?"  You can say, as Tom Lehrer does in his song <i>We
        Will All Go Together When We Go</i>, "We will drop our
        agendas and adjourn."  However, if you act all fancy and say
        shit like "Amongst the agenda is found an item specifying herp
        derp derp herp," then people will hit you.  You have been
        warned.

    <h3>Criterion</h3>
    <div class='info'>
      <div class='lemma'>
        <div class='plural'>Singular: <em>criterion</em>, plural: <em>criteria</em></div>
        <div class='never'>Never say: <em>The criteria is ...</em> or <em>The criterias are ...</em></div>
      </div>
      <div class='about'>
        This is a Greek word.  Quite a lot of Greek words for a page
        that claims to be about Latin, aren't there.
        Well, <tt>greekandlatinpluralsforyou.com</tt> is too long.
        Let's move on.  So <em>criteria</em> is the plural
        of <em>criterion</em>.  If you suspect that these Greek words
        ending in -<em>on</em> have something in common with Latin
        words ending in -<em>um</em>, you are correct!  In both
        languages, the plurals for such nouns end in
        -<em>a</em>.  <em>Labium</em>/<em>labia</em>, etc.  Note that
        unlike <em>data</em> and <em>agenda</em>, <em>criteria</em>
        doesn't get to be treated as a singular in
        English.  <em>Criterion</em> singular; <em>criteria</em>
        plural.
